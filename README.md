# CSS Repository

Welcome to the **css** repository! This repository houses a collection of web development projects with a primary focus on cascading style sheets (CSS). Each project is organized within the "projects" directory and follows a standardized naming convention for clarity and easy exploration.

## Project Structure

The "projects" directory contains individual web development projects, each identified by a two-digit number followed by the project name. For example:

```
/projects
  /00-project-name1
  /01-project-name2

```

Feel free to explore each project to delve into specific aspects of web design and development.
